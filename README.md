## Introduction
---
House Price predictions are very stressful work as we have to consider different things while buying a house like the structure and the rooms, kitchen, parking space, crime rate of area, and gardens. People donâ€™t know about the factors that influence the house price. But by using Machine learning Real Estate companies and people can easily find the house which is to be prefect for them and helps to predict the price accurately.
## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following attributes:
* **CRIM:** per capita crime rate by town
* **ZN:** proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
* **INDUS:** proportion of non-retail business acres per town
* **CHAS:** Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
* **NOX:** nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
* **RM:** average number of rooms per dwelling
* **AGE:** proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
* **DIS:** weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
* **RAD:** index of accessibility to radial highways
* **TAX:**  full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
* **PTRATIO:**  pupil-teacher ratio by town
* **B:** 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
